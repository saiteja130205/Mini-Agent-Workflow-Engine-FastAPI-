# Mini-Agent-Workflow-Engine-FastAPI-
This project implements a minimal agent workflow engine, similar in spirit to LangGraph, but simplified for clarity and educational purposes. It allows us to define nodes (Python functions), connect them with edges, maintain a shared state, support branching, looping, and execute workflows through FastAPI APIs.
